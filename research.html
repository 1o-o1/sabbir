												<h3>Byzantine Fault Tolerant Federated Learning for Machine-to-Machine Communication: A Smart City Vehicular Network</h3>
											<p><b>Abstract: </b>A common conception of smart vehicular and transportation systems is to create a fault-tolerant pair-to-pair network among the vehicles in the communication range such that they can share information about traffic, road conditions, and many more. Although there are several hurdles to overcome, recently most vehicles are equipped with  LIDAR, ultrasonic, and camera sensors for the Advance Driving Assistant System (ADAS). Two major problems in developing a machine-to-machine network with these sensors are the sheer amount of data (gigabytes per second) that needs to be sent over the communication channel and some of the nodes may not respond or can provide inaccurate Data. However, the end goal of this data is to train a certain ML or DL model for prediction and Automation. Thus using federated learning techniques in each vehicle's onboard computation unit, the main model can be trained, and each of the model parameters (A few KB) can be sent over the network instead of the data. Then this newly created model information can be validated using a specific consensus algorithm to remove the BFT problem. Central Cloud storage might also be helpful to accommodate the overall ML/DL model version history such that if any of the models proved to be falsified by misleading training data, a quick rollback  can be possible

											<h3>Taking All the Factors We Need: A Multimodal Depression Classification with Uncertainty Approximation</h3>
											<p>Depression and Anxiety are surprisingly common but generally overlooked  mental illness, where more than 5% of total population is thought to suffer from the disease. It's also the major factor behind sucide which is  fourth Common reason for death among youngsters. Although there has been several impactful research in these fields, most of the research encompasses one or two factors for detection purposes, whereas in a real world scenario, most patients go through rigorous steps of diagnosis systems. Another crucial insight about using ML/DL for any detection is that it might falsely give classification reports, which might be fatal for  depression patients. To mitigate these issues, at first we have to take all possible symptoms related to depression, and create a multimodal diagnosis system that might take any number of factors for any particular patient. These factors might include visual information, behavioral patterns, voice pitch, hyper or hypo activity and medical data like heart rate, breathing rate, screen temperature etc. If any number of factors can be addressed within the same learning model it might also be helpful for data collection and further development. The uncertainty approximation will provide important information about the ML/DL based diagnosis processes, where results from each steps may be further evaluated.
